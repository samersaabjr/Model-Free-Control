This repository contains implementations for the model-free non-adaptive controller proposed in "Multivariable Non-adaptive Controller Design" in MATLAB.

This is a discrete-time robust multivariable (nonadaptive) tracking controller that comes with a simple structure, requires very limited information on the plant model, and is relatively easy to tune.

The file "QuadrupleTank_P_type_clean.m" contains the implementation of the model-free controller on a quadruple tank process with non-minimum phase setting as described in [1].
