This repository contains implementations for the model-free non-adaptive controller proposed in "Multivariable Non-adaptive Controller Design" in MATLAB.

This is a discrete-time robust multivariable (nonadaptive) tracking controller that comes with a simple structure, requires very limited information on the plant model, and is relatively easy to tune.
